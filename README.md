# 🦦 Ferret Tetris

Ferret Tetris is a fun twist on classic Tetris where **each tetromino is shaped like a ferret**.  
Instead of square blocks or faces on each tile, **the entire piece becomes one bendy ferret** whose body follows the shape of the block and **rotates naturally** as you play.

No installs, no assets, no libraries — just open the file and play.

## 🛠 How It Works (Short Explanation)

- The game still uses standard **Tetris collision and rotation logic**.
- Each piece has a predefined **“ferret spine path”** (head → body → tail).
- Every cell knows whether it’s a **head, body, or tail segment**, so the ferret stays connected even after rotating.
- When a piece locks, the ferret shape stays intact on the board.
